This module attempts to be forgiving with regards to unlikely input formats, returning a datetime object even for dates which are ambiguous. If an element of a date/time stamp is omitted, the following rules are applied: - If AM or PM is left unspecified, a 24-hour clock is assumed, however, an hour on a 12-hour clock (``0 <= hour <= 12``) *must* be specified if AM or PM is specified. - If a time zone is omitted, a timezone-naive datetime is returned. If any other elements are missing, they are taken from the :class:`datetime.datetime` object passed to the parameter ``default``. If this results in a day number exceeding the valid number of days per month, the value falls back to the end of the month.

Lexical units are demarcated by changes in the character set, so any continuous string of letters is considered one unit, any continuous string of numbers is considered one unit.

This module attempts to be forgiving with regards to unlikely input formats, returning a datetime object even for dates which are ambiguous. If an element of a date/time stamp is omitted, the following rules are applied: - If AM or PM is left unspecified, a 24-hour clock is assumed, however, an hour on a 12-hour clock (``0 <= hour <= 12``) *must* be specified if AM or PM is specified. - If a time zone is omitted, a timezone-naive datetime is returned. If any other elements are missing, they are taken from the :class:`datetime.datetime` object passed to the parameter ``default``. If this results in a day number exceeding the valid number of days per month, the value falls back to the end of the month.

Lexical units are demarcated by changes in the character set, so any continuous string of letters is considered one unit, any continuous string of numbers is considered one unit. The main complication arises from the fact that dots ('.') can be used both as separators (e.g. "Sep.20.2009") or decimal points (e.g. "4:30:21.447"). As such, it is necessary to read the full context of any dot-separated strings before breaking it into tokens; as such, this function maintains a "token stack", for when the ambiguous context demands that multiple tokens be parsed at once. iiuuau0u u.ua.u,iu0.iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½u.,N(ua.u0.(RtpopRtNoneRR RtreadtTruetiswordtisnumtisspacetappendtlentcountt_split_decimaltsplittreplace(Rtseenlettersttokentstatetnextchartlttok((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyt	get_token@sï¿½				   	 * 	  	  	' !cCs|S(N((R((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyt__iter__ï¿½scCs%|jï¿½}|dkr!tï¿½n|S(N(R&Rt StopIteration(RR!((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyt__next__ï¿½s	cCs |jï¿½S(N(R)(R((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pytnextï¿½scCst||ï¿½ï¿½S(N(tlist(tclsts((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyRï¿½scCs |jï¿½S(u5 Whether or not the next character is part of a word (tisalpha(R,R#((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyRï¿½scCs |jï¿½S(u0 Whether the next character is part of a number (tisdigit(R,R#((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyRï¿½scCs |jï¿½S(u* Whether the next character is whitespace (R(R,R#((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyRï¿½s(t__name__t __module__tretcompileRRR&R'R)R*tclassmethodRRRR(((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyR	0s		m		 t_resultbasecBs,eZdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½ZRS(cCs(x!|jD]}t||dï¿½q WdS(N(t	__slots__tsetattrR(Rtattr((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyRï¿½scCslg}xL|jD]A}t||ï¿½}|dk	r|jd|t|ï¿½fï¿½qqWd|dj|ï¿½fS(Nu%s=%su%s(%s)u, (R6tgetattrRRtreprtjoin(Rt	classnameR$R8tvalue((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyt_reprï¿½s$cstï¿½fdï¿½ï¿½jDï¿½ï¿½S(Nc3s$|]}tï¿½|ï¿½dk	VqdS(N(R9R(t.0R8(R(s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pys ï¿½s(tsumR6(R((Rs0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyt__len__ï¿½scCs|j|jjï¿½S(N(R>t __class__R0(R((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyt__repr__ï¿½s(R0R1RR>RARC(((s0C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\parser.pyR5ï¿½s			t parserinfocBs=eZdZddddddddd	d ddd dddddgZdTdUdVdWdXdYdZgZd[d\d]d^d_d`dadbdcdddedfgZdgdhdigZdjdkgZdEdFdGgZdgZ iZ eedHï¿½ZdIï¿½Z dJï¿½ZdKï¿½ZdLï¿½ZdMï¿½ZdNï¿½ZdOï¿½ZdPï¿½ZdQï¿½ZedRï¿½ZdSï¿½ZRS(luï¿½ Class which handles what inputs are accepted.

parserinfo: A :class:`parserinfo` object containing parameters for the parser. If ``None``, the default arguments to the :class:`parserinfo` constructor are used. The ``**kwargs`` parameter takes the following keyword arguments: :param default: The default datetime object, if this is a datetime object and not ``None``, elements specified in ``timestr`` replace elements in the default object. :param ignoretz: If set ``True``, time zones in parsed strings are ignored and a naive :class:`datetime` object is returned. :param tzinfos: Additional time zone names / aliases which may be present in the string. This argument maps time zone names (and optionally offsets from those time zones) to time zones. This parameter can be a dictionary with timezone aliases mapping time zone names to time zones or a function taking two parameters (``tzname`` and ``tzoffset``) and returning a time zone. The timezones to which the names are mapped can be an integer offset from UTC in minutes or a :class:`tzinfo` object. .. doctest:: :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE >>> from dateutil.parser import parse >>> from dateutil.tz import gettz >>> tzinfos = {"BRST": -10800, "CST": gettz("America/Chicago")} >>> parse("2012-01-19 17:21:00 BRST", tzinfos=tzinfos) datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 19, 17, 21, tzinfo=tzoffset(u'BRST', -10800)) >>> parse("2012-01-19 17:21:00 CST", tzinfos=tzinfos) datetime.datetime(2012, 1, 19, 17, 21, tzinfo=tzfile('/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago')) This parameter is ignored if ``ignoretz`` is set. :param dayfirst: Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date (e.g. 01/05/09) as the day (``True``) or month (``False``). If ``yearfirst`` is set to ``True``, this distinguishes between YDM and YMD. If set to ``None``, this value is retrieved from the current :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``). :param yearfirst: Whether to interpret the first value in an ambiguous 3-integer date (e.g. 01/05/09) as the year. If ``True``, the first number is taken to be the year, otherwise the last number is taken to be the year. If this is set to ``None``, the value is retrieved from the current :class:`parserinfo` object (which itself defaults to ``False``). :param fuzzy: Whether to allow fuzzy parsing, allowing for string like "Today is January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM". :param fuzzy_with_tokens: If ``True``, ``fuzzy`` is automatically set to True, and the parser will return a tuple where the first element is the parsed :class:`datetime.datetime` datetimestamp and the second element is a tuple containing the portions of the string which were ignored: .. doctest:: >>> from dateutil.parser import parse >>> parse("Today is January 1, 2047 at 8:21:00AM", fuzzy_with_tokens=True) (datetime.datetime(2011, 1, 1, 8, 21), (u'Today is ', u' ', u'at ')) :return: Returns a :class:`datetime.datetime` object or, if the ``fuzzy_with_tokens`` option is ``True``, returns a tuple, the first element being a :class:`datetime.datetime` object, the second a tuple containing the fuzzy tokens. :raises ValueError: Raised for invalid or unknown string format, if the provided :class:`tzinfo` is not in a valid format, or if an invalid date would be created. :raises OverflowError: Raised if the parsed date exceeds the largest valid C integer on your system.

Lemburg in his `mx.DateTime `_ extension. However, notice that this type does *NOT* implement the same algorithm as his work. Do *NOT* expect it to behave like mx.DateTime's counterpart. There are two different ways to build a relativedelta instance. The first one is passing it two date/datetime classes:: relativedelta(datetime1, datetime2) The second one is passing it any number of the following keyword arguments:: relativedelta(arg1=x,arg2=y,arg3=z...) year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond: Absolute information (argument is singular); adding or subtracting a relativedelta with absolute information does not perform an aritmetic operation, but rather REPLACES the corresponding value in the original datetime with the value(s) in relativedelta. years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds: Relative information, may be negative (argument is plural); adding or subtracting a relativedelta with relative information performs the corresponding aritmetic operation on the original datetime value with the information in the relativedelta. weekday: One of the weekday instances (MO, TU, etc). These instances may receive a parameter N, specifying the Nth weekday, which could be positive or negative (like MO(+1) or MO(-2). Not specifying it is the same as specifying +1. You can also use an integer, where 0=MO. leapdays: Will add given days to the date found, if year is a leap year, and the date found is post 28 of february. yearday, nlyearday: Set the yearday or the non-leap year day (jump leap days). These are converted to day/month/leapdays information. Here is the behavior of operations with relativedelta: 1. Calculate the absolute year, using the 'year' argument, or the original datetime year, if the argument is not present. 2. Add the relative 'years' argument to the absolute year. 3. Do steps 1 and 2 for month/months. 4. Calculate the absolute day, using the 'day' argument, or the original datetime day, if the argument is not present. Then, subtract from the day until it fits in the year and month found after their operations. 5. Add the relative 'days' argument to the absolute day. Notice that the 'weeks' argument is multiplied by 7 and added to 'days'. 6. Do steps 1 and 2 for hour/hours, minute/minutes, second/seconds, microsecond/microseconds. 7. If the 'weekday' argument is present, calculate the weekday, with the given (wday, nth) tuple. wday is the index of the weekday (0-6, 0=Mon), and nth is the number of weeks to add forward or backward, depending on its signal. Notice that if the calculated date is already Monday, for example, using (0, 1) or (0, -1) won't change the day.

Lemburg in his `mx.DateTime `_ extension. However, notice that this type does *NOT* implement the same algorithm as his work. Do *NOT* expect it to behave like mx.DateTime's counterpart. There are two different ways to build a relativedelta instance. The first one is passing it two date/datetime classes:: relativedelta(datetime1, datetime2) The second one is passing it any number of the following keyword arguments:: relativedelta(arg1=x,arg2=y,arg3=z...) year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond: Absolute information (argument is singular); adding or subtracting a relativedelta with absolute information does not perform an aritmetic operation, but rather REPLACES the corresponding value in the original datetime with the value(s) in relativedelta. years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, microseconds: Relative information, may be negative (argument is plural); adding or subtracting a relativedelta with relative information performs the corresponding aritmetic operation on the original datetime value with the information in the relativedelta. weekday: One of the weekday instances (MO, TU, etc). These instances may receive a parameter N, specifying the Nth weekday, which could be positive or negative (like MO(+1) or MO(-2). Not specifying it is the same as specifying +1. You can also use an integer, where 0=MO. leapdays: Will add given days to the date found, if year is a leap year, and the date found is post 28 of february. yearday, nlyearday: Set the yearday or the non-leap year day (jump leap days). These are converted to day/month/leapdays information. Here is the behavior of operations with relativedelta: 1. Calculate the absolute year, using the 'year' argument, or the original datetime year, if the argument is not present. 2. Add the relative 'years' argument to the absolute year. 3. Do steps 1 and 2 for month/months. 4. Calculate the absolute day, using the 'day' argument, or the original datetime day, if the argument is not present. Then, subtract from the day until it fits in the year and month found after their operations. 5. Add the relative 'days' argument to the absolute day. Notice that the 'weeks' argument is multiplied by 7 and added to 'days'. 6. Do steps 1 and 2 for hour/hours, minute/minutes, second/seconds, microsecond/microseconds. 7. If the 'weekday' argument is present, calculate the weekday, with the given (wday, nth) tuple. wday is the index of the weekday (0-6, 0=Mon), and nth is the number of weeks to add forward or backward, depending on its signal. Notice that if the calculated date is already Monday, for example, using (0, 1) or (0, -1) won't change the day. icCsetdï¿½||fDï¿½ï¿½r+tdï¿½ï¿½n|rw|rwt|tjï¿½oXt|tjï¿½sjtdï¿½ï¿½nt|tjï¿½t|tjï¿½krï¿½t|tjï¿½sï¿½tjj|jï¿½ï¿½}qï¿½t|tjï¿½sï¿½tjj|jï¿½ï¿½}qï¿½nd|_d|_ d|_ d|_d|_d|_ d|_d|_d|_d|_d|_d|_d|_d|_d|_d|_d|_|jd|j|jd|j}|j|ï¿½|j|ï¿½}||krxr||kr |d7}|j|ï¿½|j|ï¿½}qï¿½Wn9x6||krF|d8}|j|ï¿½|j|ï¿½}qW||}|j|j d|_|j|_nï¿½||_||_	||d|_ ||_||_|	|_ | |_||_||_| |_||_||_||_||_||_td	ï¿½|| |||||fDï¿½ï¿½rItd ddtï¿½nt|tï¿½rht||_n	||_d}|rï¿½|}n'|rï¿½|}|d krï¿½d|_qï¿½n|rWdd ddddddddddg}xwt |ï¿½D]V\}}||krï¿½|d|_|dkr'||_n|||d|_Pqï¿½qï¿½Wtd|ï¿½ï¿½n|j!ï¿½dS(Ncss-|]#}|dk	o$|t|ï¿½kVqdS(N(Rtint(t.0tx((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pys	{ssGNon-integer years and months are ambiguous and not currently supported.s&relativedelta only diffs datetime/dateiiiiï¿½Qicss-|]#}|dk	o$t|ï¿½|kVqdS(N(RR(RR((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pys ï¿½ss2Non-integer value passed as absolute information. s4This is not a well-defined condition and will raise serrors in future versions.i;iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½iiZixiï¿½iï¿½iï¿½iï¿½ii0iNinsinvalid year day (%d)("tanyt ValueErrort isinstancetdatetimetdatet	TypeErrortfromordinalt toordinaltyearstmonthstdaystleapdaysthourstminutestsecondstmicrosecondsRtyeartmonthtdayR thourtminutetsecondtmicrosecondt _has_timet_set_monthst__radd__RtDeprecationWarningRtweekdayst enumeratet_fix(Rtdt1tdt2R&R'R(R)tweeksR*R+R,R-R.R/R0R tyeardayt nlyeardayR1R2R3R4tdtmtdeltatydaytydayidxtidxtydays((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pyR ssï¿½													 			&      														 		 cCsï¿½t|jï¿½dkrj|jt|jï¿½}t|j|dï¿½\}}|||_|j||7_nt|jï¿½dkrï¿½|jt|jï¿½}t|j|dï¿½\}}|||_|j||7_nt|jï¿½dkr>|jt|jï¿½}t|j|dï¿½\}}|||_|j||7_nt|jï¿½dkrï¿½|jt|jï¿½}t|j|dï¿½\}}|||_|j||7_nt|jï¿½dkr|jt|jï¿½}t|j|dï¿½\}}|||_|j||7_n|jsr|jsr|jsr|jsr|j dk	sr|jdk	sr|jdk	sr|j dk	r~d	|_n	d |_dS(Ni?Bi@Bi;i<�iiiiii(tabsR-tdivmodR,R+R*R(R'R&R1RR2R3R4R5(RRtdivtmod((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pyR;ï¿½s<�     $cCs|jdS(Ni(R((R((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pyR>scCs#|j|jd|d|_dS(Ni(R(R>(Rtvalue((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pyR>scCsz||_t|jï¿½dkrm|jt|jï¿½}t|j|dï¿½\}}|||_|||_n d|_dS(Niii(R'RGRHR&(RR'RRIRJ((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pyR6s  c	!Cs6t|jï¿½}t|jd|j|dï¿½}t|ï¿½}t|jd||dï¿½}t|ï¿½}t|jd||dï¿½}t|ï¿½}t|jd||ï¿½}|jd|jd|j	d	|d |d|d|d |d|j d|jd|jd|j d|jd|jd|jd|jd|jï¿½S(sI Return a version of this object represented entirely using integer values for the relative attributes. >>> relativedelta(days=1.5, hours=2).normalized() relativedelta(days=1, hours=14) :return: Returns a :class:`dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta` object. iii<�i igï¿½ï¿½.AR&R'R(R*R+R,R-R)R.R/R0R R1R2R3R4(RR(troundR*R+R,R-RR&R'R)R.R/R0R R1R2R3R4( RR(thours_fR*t	minutes_fR+t	seconds_fR,R-((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pyt normalizeds !c !Csï¿½t|tï¿½r+|jd|j|jd|j|jd|j|jd|j|jd|j|jd|j|jd|j	|j d|j pï¿½|j d	|jpï¿½|jd |jpï¿½|jd|j pï¿½|j d|jpï¿½|jd |jpï¿½|jd|jp|jd|jp|jd|jp'|jï¿½St|tjï¿½sLtdï¿½ï¿½n7|jrï¿½t|tjï¿½rï¿½tjj|jï¿½ï¿½}n|jpï¿½|j|j}|jpï¿½|j}|jr8dt|jï¿½koï¿½dknsï¿½tï¿½||j7}|dkr|d7}|d8}q8|dkr8|d8}|d7}q8nttj||ï¿½d|j p]|j ï¿½}i|d	6|d 6|d6}xBd dddgD].}t||ï¿½}|dk rï¿½|||tsetterR6RPR^R7R`RaR_Rbt__nonzero__Ret__rmul__RRhRit__truediv__R(((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pyR*s4Gr	!	#	>								 (R!RStsixRtwarningsRt__all__tobjectR ttupletrangeRRRRRRRR R9R(((s7C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\relativedelta.pytsD# -*- coding: utf-8 -*- """ The rrule module offers a small, complete, and very fast, implementation of the recurrence rules documented in the `iCalendar RFC `_, including support for caching of results.

It accepts all the keywords defined in the RFC as its constructor parameters (except byday, which was renamed to byweekday) and more. The constructor prototype is:: rrule(freq) Where freq must be one of YEARLY, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY, HOURLY, MINUTELY, or SECONDLY. Additionally, it supports the following keyword arguments: :param cache: If given, it must be a boolean value specifying to enable or disable caching of results. If you will use the same rrule instance multiple times, enabling caching will improve the performance considerably. :param dtstart: The recurrence start. Besides being the base for the recurrence, missing parameters in the final recurrence instances will also be extracted from this date. If not given, datetime.now() will be used instead. :param interval: The interval between each freq iteration. For example, when using YEARLY, an interval of 2 means once every two years, but with HOURLY, it means once every two hours. The default interval is 1. :param wkst: The week start day. Must be one of the MO, TU, WE constants, or an integer, specifying the first day of the week. This will affect recurrences based on weekly periods. The default week start is got from calendar.firstweekday(), and may be modified by calendar.setfirstweekday(). :param count: How many occurrences will be generated. :param until: If given, this must be a datetime instance, that will specify the limit of the recurrence. If a recurrence instance happens to be the same as the datetime instance given in the until keyword, this will be the last occurrence. :param bysetpos: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, positive or negative. Each given integer will specify an occurrence number, corresponding to the nth occurrence of the rule inside the frequency period. For example, a bysetpos of -1 if combined with a MONTHLY frequency, and a byweekday of (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR), will result in the last work day of every month. :param bymonth: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the months to apply the recurrence to. :param bymonthday: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the month days to apply the recurrence to. :param byyearday: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the year days to apply the recurrence to. :param byweekno: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the week numbers to apply the recurrence to. Week numbers have the meaning described in ISO8601, that is, the first week of the year is that containing at least four days of the new year. :param byweekday: If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO), a sequence of integers, one of the weekday constants (MO, TU, etc), or a sequence of these constants. When given, these variables will define the weekdays where the recurrence will be applied. It's also possible to use an argument n for the weekday instances, which will mean the nth occurrence of this weekday in the period. For example, with MONTHLY, or with YEARLY and BYMONTH, using FR(+1) in byweekday will specify the first friday of the month where the recurrence happens. Notice that in the RFC documentation, this is specified as BYDAY, but was renamed to avoid the ambiguity of that keyword. :param byhour: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the hours to apply the recurrence to. :param byminute: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the minutes to apply the recurrence to. :param bysecond: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the seconds to apply the recurrence to. :param byeaster: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, positive or negative. Each integer will define an offset from the Easter Sunday. Passing the offset 0 to byeaster will yield the Easter Sunday itself. This is an extension to the RFC specification.

It accepts all the keywords defined in the RFC as its constructor parameters (except byday, which was renamed to byweekday) and more. The constructor prototype is:: rrule(freq) Where freq must be one of YEARLY, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY, HOURLY, MINUTELY, or SECONDLY. Additionally, it supports the following keyword arguments: :param cache: If given, it must be a boolean value specifying to enable or disable caching of results. If you will use the same rrule instance multiple times, enabling caching will improve the performance considerably. :param dtstart: The recurrence start. Besides being the base for the recurrence, missing parameters in the final recurrence instances will also be extracted from this date. If not given, datetime.now() will be used instead. :param interval: The interval between each freq iteration. For example, when using YEARLY, an interval of 2 means once every two years, but with HOURLY, it means once every two hours. The default interval is 1. :param wkst: The week start day. Must be one of the MO, TU, WE constants, or an integer, specifying the first day of the week. This will affect recurrences based on weekly periods. The default week start is got from calendar.firstweekday(), and may be modified by calendar.setfirstweekday(). :param count: How many occurrences will be generated. :param until: If given, this must be a datetime instance, that will specify the limit of the recurrence. If a recurrence instance happens to be the same as the datetime instance given in the until keyword, this will be the last occurrence. :param bysetpos: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, positive or negative. Each given integer will specify an occurrence number, corresponding to the nth occurrence of the rule inside the frequency period. For example, a bysetpos of -1 if combined with a MONTHLY frequency, and a byweekday of (MO, TU, WE, TH, FR), will result in the last work day of every month. :param bymonth: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the months to apply the recurrence to. :param bymonthday: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the month days to apply the recurrence to. :param byyearday: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the year days to apply the recurrence to. :param byweekno: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the week numbers to apply the recurrence to. Week numbers have the meaning described in ISO8601, that is, the first week of the year is that containing at least four days of the new year. :param byweekday: If given, it must be either an integer (0 == MO), a sequence of integers, one of the weekday constants (MO, TU, etc), or a sequence of these constants. When given, these variables will define the weekdays where the recurrence will be applied. It's also possible to use an argument n for the weekday instances, which will mean the nth occurrence of this weekday in the period. For example, with MONTHLY, or with YEARLY and BYMONTH, using FR(+1) in byweekday will specify the first friday of the month where the recurrence happens. Notice that in the RFC documentation, this is specified as BYDAY, but was renamed to avoid the ambiguity of that keyword. :param byhour: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the hours to apply the recurrence to. :param byminute: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the minutes to apply the recurrence to. :param bysecond: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, meaning the seconds to apply the recurrence to. :param byeaster: If given, it must be either an integer, or a sequence of integers, positive or negative. Each integer will define an offset from the Easter Sunday. Passing the offset 0 to byeaster will yield the Easter Sunday itself. This is an extension to the RFC specification. ic Csl tt|ï¿½j|ï¿½|s:tjjï¿½jddï¿½}n?t|tjï¿½sgtjj|jï¿½ï¿½}n|jddï¿½}||_	|j |_||_||_ ||_i|_|rï¿½t|tjï¿½rï¿½tjj|jï¿½ï¿½}n||_|r|rtdtï¿½n|dkr)tjï¿½|_n't|tï¿½rD||_n|j|_|dkrhd|_nï¿½t|tï¿½rï¿½|dksï¿½d|koï¿½dknrï¿½tdï¿½ï¿½n|f|_n[t|ï¿½|_xI|jD]>}|dksd|kodknrï¿½tdï¿½ï¿½qï¿½qï¿½W|jr5|j|jd|f}ntt"t#|ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½|_!d|jkr{|j!|jd|||d|jï¿½ï¿½q Wqï¿½	Wqï¿½	W|j<�j?ï¿½t|j<�ï¿½|_<�dS(Ntmicrosecondisï¿½Using both 'count' and 'until' is inconsistent with RFC 2445 and has been deprecated in dateutil.

at the same level as `FREQ` (e.g. `FREQ=HOURLY,BYHOUR={2,4,7},INTERVAL=3`), there are some specifications which cannot be reached given some starting conditions. This occurs whenever the interval is not coprime with the base of a given unit and the difference between the starting position and the ending position is not coprime with the greatest common denominator between the interval and the base. For example, with a FREQ of hourly starting at 17:00 and an interval of 4, the only valid values for BYHOUR would be {21, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17}, because 4 and 24 are not coprime. :param start: Specifies the starting position. :param byxxx: An iterable containing the list of allowed values. :param base: The largest allowable value for the specified frequency (e.g. 24 hours, 60 minutes). This does not preserve the type of the iterable, returning a set, since the values should be unique and the order is irrelevant, this will speed up later lookups. In the event of an empty set, raises a :exception:`ValueError`, as this results in an empty rrule. iis+Invalid rrule byxxx generates an empty set.( Rï¿½R=RRRtRï¿½Rï¿½R6R(RRCReRftcsettnumti_gcd((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyt__construct_bysetï¿½s	 )cCsdd}xWtd|dï¿½D]B}t||j|ï¿½\}}||7}||kr||fSqWdS(sï¿½ Calculates the next value in a sequence where the `FREQ` parameter is specified along with a `BYXXX` parameter at the same "level" (e.g. `HOURLY` specified with `BYHOUR`). :param value: The old value of the component. :param byxxx: The `BYXXX` set, which should have been generated by `rrule._construct_byset`, or something else which checks that a valid rule is present. :param base: The largest allowable value for the specified frequency (e.g. 24 hours, 60 minutes). If a valid value is not found after `base` iterations (the maximum number before the sequence would start to repeat), this raises a :exception:`ValueError`, as no valid values were found. This returns a tuple of `divmod(n*interval, base)`, where `n` is the smallest number of `interval` repetitions until the next specified value in `byxxx` is found. iiN(R7Rï¿½Rt(RRï¿½ReRftaccumulatorRï¿½Rï¿½((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyt__mod_distanceï¿½s ( R$R%t__doc__R'RRRï¿½R,Rï¿½Rï¿½(((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyR(sU	ï¿½	>	ï¿½	/Rï¿½cBsï¿½eZdddddddddd	d ddd dgZdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Z	dï¿½Z dï¿½ZRS(Rtlastyeart lastmonthRï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½tyearweekdayRï¿½tmrangeRï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½cCs1x!|jD]}t||dï¿½q W||_dS(N(R&tsetattrR'R(RRtattr((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRscCsB|j}||jkrdtj|ï¿½|_dtj|dï¿½|_tj|ddï¿½}|jï¿½|_	|j ï¿½|_tj|ddï¿½j ï¿½}|jdkrï¿½t|_ t|_t|_t||_t|_n1t|_ t|_t|_t||_t|_|jsd|_qdg|jd|_d|j|jd}}|dkrï¿½d}|j|j|jd}n |j|}t|dï¿½\}	} |	| d}xï¿½|jD]ï¿½}|dkrï¿½||d7}nd|koï¿½|knsqï¿½n|dkr?||dd} ||krE| d|8} qEn|} xEtdï¿½D]7}d|j| <| d7} |j| |jkrRPqRqRWqï¿½Wd|jkr(||d} ||krï¿½| d|8} n| |jkr(xHtdï¿½D]7}d|j| <| d7} |j| |jkrï¿½Pqï¿½qï¿½Wq(n|rd|jkrï¿½tj|dddï¿½j ï¿½}d||jd}dtj|dï¿½}|dkrï¿½d}d|||jddd}qï¿½d|j|dd}nd}||jkrx$t|ï¿½D]} d|j| W|||fS(Ni(R'Rï¿½Rï¿½R7(RRï¿½R~RtdsetRCRï¿½R:((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRï¿½ï¿½s cCsï¿½dg|jd}tj|||ï¿½jï¿½|j}|}xEtdï¿½D]7}|||<|d7}|j||jj	krIPqIqIW|||fS(Nii( R'Rï¿½RlRï¿½RpRï¿½R7Rï¿½RR{(RRï¿½R~RRR:RCR<�((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRï¿½ï¿½s"  cCsMdg|j}tj|||ï¿½jï¿½|j}|||<|||dfS(Ni(R'Rï¿½RlRï¿½RpRï¿½(RRï¿½R~RRR:((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRï¿½ï¿½s" c Csjg}|j}xJ|jD]?}x6|jD]+}|jtj|||d|jï¿½ï¿½q)WqW|jï¿½|S(NRj(RRï¿½Rï¿½R8RlRï¿½RrRï¿½(RRï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½ttsetR((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRï¿½ï¿½s	 cCsVg}|j}x6|jD]+}|jtj|||d|jï¿½ï¿½qW|jï¿½|S(NRj(RRï¿½R8RlRï¿½RrRï¿½(RRï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½RR((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRï¿½ï¿½s	) cCs"tj|||d|jjï¿½fS(NRj(RlRï¿½RRr(RRï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRï¿½ï¿½s(R$R%R&RRï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½Rï¿½(((s/C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\dateutil\rrule.pyRï¿½ s			ï¿½				 cBs]eZdZdefdï¿½ï¿½YZedï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Zdï¿½Z	dï¿½Z dï¿½ZRS(	sL The rruleset type allows more complex recurrence setups, mixing multiple rules, dates, exclusion rules, and exclusion dates.

Overrides ANDROID_SERIAL environment variable. -p - simple product name like 'sooner', or a relative/absolute path to a product out directory like 'out/target/product/sooner'. If -p is not specified, the ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT environment variable is used, which must be an absolute path. -H - Name of adb server host (default: localhost) -P - Port of adb server (default: 5037) devices [-l] - list all connected devices ('-l' will also list device qualifiers) connect [:] - connect to a device via TCP/IP Port 5555 is used by default if no port number is specified. disconnect [[:]] - disconnect from a TCP/IP device. Port 5555 is used by default if no port number is specified. Using this command with no additional arguments will disconnect from all connected TCP/IP devices. device commands: adb push [-p] - copy file/dir to device ('-p' to display the transfer progress) adb pull [-p] [-a] [] - copy file/dir from device ('-p' to display the transfer progress) ('-a' means copy timestamp and mode) adb sync [ ] - copy host->device only if changed (-l means list but don't copy) (see 'adb help all') adb shell - run remote shell interactively adb shell - run remote shell command adb emu - run emulator console command adb logcat [ ] - View device log adb forward --list - list all forward socket connections. the format is a list of lines with the following format: " " " " "\n" adb forward - forward socket connections forward specs are one of: tcp: localabstract: localreserved: localfilesystem: dev: jdwp: (remote only) adb forward --no-rebind - same as 'adb forward ' but fails if is already forwarded adb forward --remove - remove a specific forward socket connection adb forward --remove-all - remove all forward socket connections adb reverse --list - list all reverse socket connections from device adb reverse - reverse socket connections reverse specs are one of: tcp: localabstract: localreserved: localfilesystem: adb reverse --norebind - same as 'adb reverse ' but fails if is already reversed. adb reverse --remove - remove a specific reversed socket connection adb reverse --remove-all - remove all reversed socket connections from device adb jdwp - list PIDs of processes hosting a JDWP transport adb install [-lrtsd] adb install-multiple [-lrtsdp] - push this package file to the device and install it (-l: forward lock application) (-r: replace existing application) (-t: allow test packages) (-s: install application on sdcard) (-d: allow version code downgrade) (-p: partial application install) adb uninstall [-k] - remove this app package from the device ('-k' means keep the data and cache directories) adb bugreport - return all information from the device that should be included in a bug report. adb backup [-f ] [-apk|-noapk] [-obb|-noobb] [-shared|-noshared] [-all] [-system|-nosystem] [] - write an archive of the device's data to . If no -f option is supplied then the data is written to "backup.ab" in the current directory. (-apk|-noapk enable/disable backup of the .apks themselves in the archive; the default is noapk.) (-obb|-noobb enable/disable backup of any installed apk expansion (aka .obb) files associated with each application; the default is noobb.) (-shared|-noshared enable/disable backup of the device's shared storage / SD card contents; the default is noshared.) (-all means to back up all installed applications) (-system|-nosystem toggles whether -all automatically includes system applications; the default is to include system apps) ( is the list of applications to be backed up. If the -all or -shared flags are passed, then the package list is optional. Applications explicitly given on the command line will be included even if -nosystem would ordinarily cause them to be omitted.) adb restore - restore device contents from the backup archive adb disable-verity - disable dm-verity checking on USERDEBUG builds adb keygen - generate adb public/private key. The private key is stored in , and the public key is stored in .pub. Any existing files are overwritten. adb help - show this help message adb version - show version num scripting: adb wait-for-device - block until device is online adb start-server - ensure that there is a server running adb kill-server - kill the server if it is running adb get-state - prints: offline | bootloader | device adb get-serialno - prints: adb get-devpath - prints: adb status-window - continuously print device status for a specified device adb remount - remounts the /system and /vendor (if present) partitions on the device read-write adb reboot [bootloader|recovery] - reboots the device, optionally into the bootloader or recovery program adb reboot-bootloader - reboots the device into the bootloader adb root - restarts the adbd daemon with root permissions adb usb - restarts the adbd daemon listening on USB adb tcpip - restarts the adbd daemon listening on TCP on the specified port networking: adb ppp [parameters] - Run PPP over USB.

    The ``UniversalDetector`` class underlies the ``chardet.detect`` function
    and coordinates all of the different charset probers.

    To get a ``dict`` containing an encoding and its confidence, you can simply
    run:

    .. code::

            u = UniversalDetector()
            u.feed(some_bytes)
            u.close()
            detected = u.result

        Takes a chunk of a document and feeds it through all of the relevant
        charset probers.

        After calling ``feed``, you can check the value of the ``done``
        attribute to see if you need to continue feeding the
        ``UniversalDetector`` more data, or if it has made a prediction
        (in the ``result`` attribute).

        .. note::
           You should always call ``close`` when you're done feeding in your
           document if ``done`` is not already ``True``.
